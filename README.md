# gui
User interface for schedule planner

This repo should contain the html files for each page, a servlet Java class to manage the html pages, and a Java class for connecting to the databse and pulling information from there (the servlet class and this class may possibly be combined into one). For the servlet and html pages, we need Apache Tomchat running. For reading information from the SQL databse into our GUI, we need mysql-connector-java-8.0.22.jar.
